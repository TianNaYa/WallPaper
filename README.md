 Set html file to desktop

You need to place a wallpaper.png icon in the generated executable file directory. This icon will be used by the program as the system tray.

When the program is opened for the first time, a file selection dialog box will pop up. Please select your favorite HTML file. This file will be rendered as your desktop background.

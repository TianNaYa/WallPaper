# WallPaper
 Set html file to desktop

You need to place a wallpaper.png icon in the generated executable file directory. This icon will be used by the program as the system tray.

When the program is opened for the first time, a file selection dialog box will pop up. Please select your favorite HTML file. This file will be rendered as your desktop background.

To compile this project, please use the MSVC compilation tool of Qt 6+ to build the project.
